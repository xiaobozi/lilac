It is - **a fast & simple & easy-to-use static blog generator**.

lilac comes from linux, and for linux.

- repo: [lilac/gh-pages](https://github.com/hit9/lilac/tree/gh-pages)

- site: http://lilac.hit9.org

Featrues
--------

- [Toml](https://github.com/mojombo/toml) & Markdown([GFM](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/)) based

- 100% in Python (any linux distribution comes with python)

- tags & feed & templates & Code highlighting

- jinja2 templating language

- simple enough (no categories, only tags; minimal configuration)

Quick Start
-----------

1. install `lilac`:

    ```bash
    mkdir MyBlog && cd MyBlog
    virtualenv venv
    . venv/bin/activate
    pip install git+git://github.com/hit9/lilac.git
    ```

    the commands above install lilac to directory `MyBlog/`, each time you use lilac, you need to activate the virtual environment first:

    ```bash
    . venv/bin/activate
    ```

    you can also install `lilac` to system (global install):

    ```bash
    pip install git+git://github.com/hit9/lilac.git
    ```

2. deploy your blog:

    ```
    lilac deploy
    ```

    this step, `lilac` generates you a `Makefile` to manage blog

3. edit `config.toml` to meet your needs.


4. see your blog in action:

    ```
    make serve
    ```

    lilac will start a web server here, and watch your source files for changes to auto rebuild.

    point your browser to http://0.0.0.0:8888 to preview your blog.

Syntax
-------

What's the syntax of post? You can look at this post's source: [/src/post/lilac.md](/src/post/lilac.md)

Here is a sample post, it is made up of two parts: `header` and `body`, `header` is in [Toml](https://github.com/mojombo/toml) and 
`body` is in [github flavored markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/):

```
title = "Hello World!"
datetime = "2013-05-21 14:30"

Writing

Your only task is, to write posts. 

Each time starting blog, just follow the simple 3 steps:

1. touch a new file in `src/post`, for example: `src/post/hello-world.md`

2. run lilac to work: `make serve`

3. start writing and see build result in browser.

Upgrade
-------

to upgrade lilac to lastest version:

```
pip install git+git://github.com/hit9/lilac.git --upgrade
```

OS Plat
--------

Only works on \*nix. (linux tested)

Templates
---------

The built-in templates is called `classic`, also the templates of demo site. (Maybe the word `templates` should be replaced with `theme`)

lilac uses jinja2 to render templates, see [classic](https://github.com/hit9/lilac/tree/master/lilac/resources/classic) to learn how to make your own templates.

Make one, and let me know(via email or github's issues).
