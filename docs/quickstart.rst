Quick Start
===========

Eager to get started? Now this section assumes that you have lilac installed.

.. _deploy:

Create a New Blog
-----------------

You need to create a new directory for your new blog, and then run `lilac deploy` in the empty directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir MyBlog
    $ cd MyBlog
    $ lilac deploy

You may want to run `ls` to see what has happened:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ls
    classic  config.toml  Makefile  src  venv

After this step, lilac generates you a sample config file `config.toml`, a sample post
file `src/post/sample.md`, and the default theme `classic <https://github.com/hit9/lilac-theme-classic>`_.

And, lilac generates a :ref:`Makefile <makefile>` to manage blog.

Now, what to do next is configuring our fresh blog.

Configure your Blog
-------------------

The configuration is dead minimal, let's take a look at the `config.toml`::

    root_path = ""
    
    [blog]
    name = "Make Difference"
    description = "Here goes your blog's description" 
    url = "http://your-blog.org"
    theme = "classic"
    
    [author]
    name = "me"
    email = "me@some.com"
    
    [disqus]
    shortname = "your-disqus-short-name"

    [theme.vars]
    github = "your-github-username"
    
The configuration is in `TOML <https://github.com/mojombo/toml>`_, but you really needn't to
learn this language, it is obvious and simple.

Now you need to edit the sample configuration generated by lilac.

Note: **You need to set 'root_path' only if you are deploying your blog to sub_directory**

To learn more about configuration, see also :ref:`configuration <config>`.

Choose a Theme
---------------

Don't like the classic theme? Go to :ref:`the theme list <theme_list>` to choose one.

Just clone the theme repo down, for example, the theme `less <https://github.com/hit9/lilac-theme-less>`_::

    $ git clone git://github.com/hit9/lilac-theme-less.git less

and then set "theme" to "less" in config.toml::

    theme = "less"

See :ref:`themes <themes>` to learn more.

Create a New Post
-----------------

Each time your start with a new post, you need to touch a new file under directory `src/post`:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ vim src/post/Hello-World.md

Here is a sample post::

    title = "Hello World!"
    datetime = "2013-06-05 17:12"
    -------
    # Hello World!

You can go to :ref:`Post's Syntax <post>` to learn more.

Build Site
----------

You can fire up another shell to run lilac's server:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make serve

This command will start a web server here and tell lilac to start watch file changes - 
once you update source files, lilac will auto rebuild the blog.

To see build results in action, point your browser at http://localhost:8888

For more about building server, see command :ref:`serve <command_serve>`

Writing Steps
-------------

Each time writing a new post, you just do these steps:

1. activate the environment if you install lilac in virtualenv.

2. run lilac's server.

3. touch a new file under `src/post/` and then start writing.

4. see results in browser after doing a save.

------------

I think reading these will be very helpful: :ref:`Post Syntax <post>`, :ref:`Commands <commands>`, :ref:`Configuration <config>`.
