Sample Post
-----------

A post is made up of two parts: header and body.

The header is in [TOML](https://github.com/mojombo/toml) and body is in Github Flavored Markdown,
the two parts are separated with a '---' like separator.

```
title = "Hello World"
datetime = "2013-06-05 19:38"
tags = ["sample", "some-tag"]
----------

# Here is markdown content
```

Commands
---------

Show help:

    $ lilac --help

Show version:

    $ lilac --version

To deploy a new blog in new-created directory:

    $ lilac deploy

To build site from source to htmls:

    $ lilac build

To remove all htmls lilac built:

    $ lilac clean

To start a simple HTTP server:

    $ lilac serve

You can tell lilac which port to use(the default port is 8888):

    $ lilac serve 8080

To watch source changes the same time when the cute web server running:

    $ lilac serve --watch

When you save your writings, lilac can detect the changes and start rebuilding.

Themes
------

You really should manage your theme in a standalone git repository, and use it as a submodule of your blog's
submodule if your blog is under git versioning too.

For instance, add theme classic a submodule of your blog's repo:

    $ git submodule add git://github.com/hit9/lilac-theme-classic.git classic

If you want to modify a theme created by someone else(i.e. classic), just fork his(or her) repo, and then modify it.

But it's 100% ok to use themes not in the submodule way.

Theme list:

- [classic](https://github.com/hit9/lilac-theme-classic) - the default theme for lilac. by @hit9
- [less](https://github.com/hit9/lilac-theme-less) - a clean theme for lilac. by @hit9
